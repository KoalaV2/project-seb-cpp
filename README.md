This is a project of mine to further improve my daily life automation and programming skills. What this is is a custom made AI which is fully programmed and built by myself, it is going to include a bunch of projects of mine and eventually voice recognition.

**warning, optimized for Linux some things may not work for windows**

**Roadmap**

1. Weather info
2. Google search
3. Light control 
4. Voice controlling 
5. ~~SSH-info script~~
